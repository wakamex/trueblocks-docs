Note: The following assumes you have a copy of (either by having built it yourself or downloaded it) the TrueBlocks Appearance Index.
Preliminaries We start by extracting from the chain all the transactions for the address in question. We will use a randomly selected address that we know owns a number of different tokens.
chifra list 0x03fdcadc09559262f40f5ea61c720278264eb1da
This produces a list of 2,129 appearances (at the time of this writing).</description></item><item><title>Running Against Multiple Rpc Endpoints</title><link>/blog/running-against-multiple-rpc-endpoints/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 17:13:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/running-against-multiple-rpc-endpoints/</guid><description>One user asked if it was possible to run TrueBlocks against multiple RPC endpoints at the same time. This is short recipe to accomplish just that.
Preliminaries The first thing to understand is that the TrueBlocks core runs against a local configuration file stored in your $HOME folder called $HOME/.local/share/TrueBlocks/trueBlocks.toml. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost ridiculously simple file.
The file gets created and populated with default values the first time you build TrueBlocks.</description></item><item><title>Showing ERC-20 Transfers</title><link>/blog/showing-erc-20-transfers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 08:00:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/showing-erc-20-transfers/</guid><description>A TrueBlocks recipe to show every ERC20 Transfer event from a given smart contract.
Note: The following assumes you have a copy of (either by having built it yourself or downloaded it) the TrueBlocks Appearance Index. These instructions also assume that the address you&amp;rsquo;re querying is an ERC 20 smart contract.
Preliminaries To get started, we want to extract (from the TrueBlocks index) a list of every transaction that our address has ever appeared in.</description></item></channel></rss>
