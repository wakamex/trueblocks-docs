The storm was about the topic of indexing the Ethereum blockchain. As is usually the case with my tweetstorms, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I explained myself well during the thunder and lightning, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a moment during the lull to better explain myself. So this is an explanation for Nick (and anyone else who&amp;rsquo;s listening) about how TrueBlocks indexes the Ethereum blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Traversers for TrueBlocks</title><link>/blog/dynamic-traversers-for-trueblocks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 12:29:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/dynamic-traversers-for-trueblocks/</guid><description>Dynamic Traversers in TrueBlocks Ethereum nodes come to consensus on a world-wide global ledger of smart contract invocations every 14 seconds. Everyone know this. This is what we celebrate about the chain. Not only is this data world-wide and consented-to, but it is also permissionless. At least that’s what we’re supposed to believe.
But, is it really permissionless?
I think the answer to that question is a resounding “No.” Ask yourself how you personally get data from the Ethereum blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Building Your Own Ethereum Archive Node</title><link>/blog/building-your-own-ethereum-archive-node/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:21:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/building-your-own-ethereum-archive-node/</guid><description>This article is incomplete in the extreme.
[Jan 20, 2021: Since writing this article, we’ve come upon a project called TurboGeth. It reduces the size of the hard drive needed for an archive node from 6TB to around 1.5TB. Significant difference. Same data. Less costs.]
In the first part, we simply present pictures and prices for the components we used to build the two Ethereum archive nodes we run in house.</description></item><item><title>How Accurate is EtherScan?</title><link>/blog/how-accurate-is-etherscan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 03:59:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/how-accurate-is-etherscan/</guid><description>Why build an 18-decimal place accurate ledger if it doesn’t balance?

I had a call this morning with a cryptocurrency accountant. He’s a wonderful fellow. One of those people who can happily wade through thousands of rows of a spreadsheet trying to get the digits to behave themselves. He’s a man after my own heart.
This accountant — call him Mr. Green — makes a good living helping people do their crypto-taxes.</description></item><item><title>Simple Undeniable Facts</title><link>/blog/simple-undeniable-facts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 04:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/simple-undeniable-facts/</guid><description>One of the reasons I fell in love with blockchain tech way back in 2013 was because I felt that for the first time in history, engineers had created a system that could produced undeniable data. Undeniable access — yes, but more importantly, undeniably high-quality data. That was a paradigm shift.
While, technically, the data on a blockchain may be untrue, what is mathematically undeniable is that at least 51% of the participants have agreed that the data is consistent — maybe that’s as close as we can get to data being ‘true’.</description></item><item><title>A Time Ordered Index of Time Ordered Immutable Data</title><link>/blog/a-time-ordered-index-of-time-ordered-immutable-data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:13:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/a-time-ordered-index-of-time-ordered-immutable-data/</guid><description>Did you ever notice that the only way to get the history of an Ethereum account is to visit a fully-centralized, database-driven, old-fashioned web-2.0 website?
Every time I use one of those sites (and I use them all the time), I think to myself: They’re watching me. They’ve attached my IP address to my address and in the future, they will wildly invading my privacy…but I need them…
Recently we demoed a fully decentralized blockchain explorer built on TrueBlocks.</description></item><item><title>Indexing Addresses on the Ethereum Blockchain</title><link>/blog/indexing-addresses-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 02:30:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/indexing-addresses-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/</guid><description>Given a blockchain, our goal was to create a list of every appearance of every address in any block on that chain. We define an “appearance” as either the use of the address in one of the common ‘address’ fields of a transaction (such as to, from, or contractAddress) or its use as data in one of the data fields in a transaction. We do not check numeric fields such as value or gasUsed.</description></item><item><title>Mother May I?</title><link>/blog/mother-may-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 19:40:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/mother-may-i/</guid><description>A New Way to Think About Data APIs
When I was a kid, we used to play a game called “Mother May I”. In the game, the person who was it, called “Mother”, would stand on one end of the room and the players would stand on the other. The players would shout out things such as, “Mother, may I take one giant step forward?” or “Mother, may I take two scissors steps?</description></item><item><title>Counting Shit on Ethereum</title><link>/blog/counting-shit-on-ethereum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 01:50:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/counting-shit-on-ethereum/</guid><description>I like to count shit. I’ll count anything I can find. Cracks in the sidewalk. Pennies in a cup.
I also like to make lists. In fact, at one point in my life, combining my two passions, I was maintaining a list of over 350 rules related to how to pick up pennies without incurring bad luck.
Yes. I suffer a bit from OCD (but happily).
Recently, Pedro Gomes made a tweet asking if anyone had a list of the most frequently called function signatures on the Ethereum blockchain.</description></item><item><title>TrueBlarks</title><link>/blog/trueblarks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 22:18:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/trueblarks/</guid><description>I wanted to share with you (through a series of charts) what happens when one releases a world-class data scientist such as Ed Mazurek on fresh-baked Ethereum difficulty data.
You get TrueBlarks (that’s a portmanteau of “TrueBlocks” and “R” in case you were wondering). If you don’t know about “R” and R Studio, you should. It’s amazing.
With little to no explanation, I am going to copy and paste the “R” code right next to the chart used to create it.</description></item></channel></rss>
