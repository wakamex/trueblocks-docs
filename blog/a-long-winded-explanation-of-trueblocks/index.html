have deep, deep respect. The storm was about the topic of indexing the
Ethereum blockchain. As is usually the case with my tweetstorms, I don&rsquo;t
think I explained myself well during the thunder and lightning, so I
thought I&rsquo;d take a moment during the lull to better explain myself. So
this is an explanation for Nick (and anyone else who&rsquo;s listening) about
how TrueBlocks indexes the Ethereum blockchain.</p><h2 id=chifra>Chifra<a href=#chifra class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The first thing I want to discuss is a command line program we&rsquo;ve
written called <strong>chifra</strong>. Like git, <strong>chifra</strong> is an overarching tool
that gives access to many other tools. Here&rsquo;s the help screen:</p><pre><code class=language-txt>  Accounts:

  Other:

    slurp         fetch data from EtherScan for any address
</code></pre><p>You can see a bunch of interesting tools. We&rsquo;ll start with one called
<strong>chifra blocks</strong>.</p><h2 id=a-simple-tool-chifra-blocks>A Simple Tool: chifra blocks<a href=#a-simple-tool-chifra-blocks class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Just to get us started I&rsquo;m going to discuss a very simple tool called
<strong>chifra blocks</strong>. Like many of the TrueBlocks tools, <strong>chifra blocks</strong>
is in some ways a front-end for the <em>eth_getBlock*</em> RPC calls. For
example, one may run:</p><p><code>chifra blocks 1000</code></p><p>and the tool will return the JSON data for block 1000. But as is also
true of all TrueBlocks tools, <strong>chifra blocks</strong> extends the RPC to make
it more useful. One simple way it does this is by allowing you to
specify block ranges and block steps. So,</p><p><code>chifra blocks 1000-2000:10</code></p><p>exports the JSON data for every 10th block between block 1000 and 2000.
There are a number of other options (including exporting to csv and tab
delimited data), but I will focus on just one that directly affects the
issue of indexing the chain:</p><p><code>chifra blocks --uniq_tx 12000000</code></p><p>exports what we call &rsquo;every appearance of every address in the block&rsquo;.
&lsquo;Appearance&rsquo; here is an important concept. An &lsquo;appearance&rsquo; includes
obvious things, such as when an address appears as the <em>from</em> or <em>to</em>
address in a transaction, but there are many other ways an address may
be an appearance.</p><p>An address is an appearance if it is the source of events in the event
logs. It can be an appearance as any of the topics of an event. It can
be a newly created smart contract, the winning miner for the block, one
of the uncles in the block, etc. There are about 20 different places
where an address may appear.</p><p>TrueBlocks finds them all. In fact, for every 100 &lsquo;appearances&rsquo; that
EtherScan returns using all four of it&rsquo;s available APIs for an address,
TrueBlocks finds 180 appearances.</p><p>The above command returns something like this:</p><p><img src=/blog/2021/uniq-blocks.png alt="Long list of unique blocks"></p><p>Perhaps you can see the start of an index of appearances in the above
output.</p><h2 id=scraping>Scraping<a href=#scraping class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Ethereum is continually producing data. Every 14 seconds a new block
appears.</p><p>The next tool I&rsquo;d like to discuss is called <strong>chifra scrape</strong>, which,
like the chain, runs continually. Each time <strong>chifra scrape</strong> runs, it
looks for new blocks and with each new block, it does a very simple
thing: it runs the above <strong>--uniq_tx</strong> command against the block to
extract the list of address appearances in that block. Unlike <strong>chifra
blocks</strong> which simply outputs the list of appearances to the screen,
<strong>chifra scrape</strong> stores the addresses in a file on the end user&rsquo;s
machine.</p><p>An important note: the TrueBlocks index is built on the end user&rsquo;s
machine. Getting the data to the end user&rsquo;s machine is the whole point
of decentralization. This ensures both autonomy and--really
importantly--speed. Local data is orders of magnitude faster than
remote data. This is one of the most important aspects of what
TrueBlocks has done.</p><p>So, <strong>chifra scrape</strong> watches every block, extracts every Ethereum
address that appears anywhere in that block, and stores those addresses
for later lightning-fast querying. Pretty standard stuff, but there&rsquo;s a
serious twist.</p><h2 id=a-sort-of-index>A Sort-Of Index<a href=#a-sort-of-index class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p><strong>chifra scrape</strong> builds an index─sort of. I say &ldquo;sort of&rdquo; because
the index isn&rsquo;t the traditional Web 2.0 database index with which you
are probably familiar. That is because the data is immutable and we want
to keep it that way. We want to make sure we preserve the Ethereum
data&rsquo;s immutability if possible.</p><p>A blockchain is a time ordered log of transactions. (<a href=https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-time-ordered-index-of-time-ordered-immutable-data-e28ced3417cc>We&rsquo;ve written about
this
here</a>).
The addresses that appear in each transaction are, as a result,
interspersed. This is a good thing. Because the data is time ordered, it
can be made immutable. As each crumb in the trail of crumbs is laid
down, if one ties the crumb to the previous crumbs (with a cryptographic
hash), the data cannot be altered. In other words, the time-ordered
blockchain data is
immutable.</p><p><img src=/blog/2021/index-sort-of.png alt="A color coded index"></p><p>This is what we all love about blockchain data.</p><h2 id=an-index-is-not-a-time-ordered-log>An Index is not a Time-Ordered Log<a href=#an-index-is-not-a-time-ordered-log class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>An index contains the same data as the time ordered log, but the data is
no longer sorted by time. The data is sorted by whatever is being
indexed. In our case, this means the index is sorted by address (below,
color represents addresses):</p><p><img src=/blog/2021/index-colors.png alt="Address and index address"></p><p>If one is building a time-ordered log, one may simply append new records
to the end of the list, leaving the previous data untouched. If, on the
other hand, one is building an index, one must sort periodically so that
future queries are efficient.</p><p>This need for sorting destroys the time-ordered nature of the data --
and therefore it destroys the ability to keep the data immutabile. Worse
than that, every time a new address is added to the index, one must
re-sort, thereby breaking the immutability of the data over and over
again.</p><p>We&rsquo;re stuck in a conundrum. We don&rsquo;t want to forgo the immutability of
the data, but we need to sort the data after every block in order to
efficiently query it. (Our goal, eventually, is to make this index
available to ourselves and all of our users over IPFS -- and
immutable--and super cheap--data store.)</p><p>So what to do?</p><p>We cannot add new records to the index because it will continually
change the IPFS location of the index file. However, we must continually
add new records to the index in order to be able to query right up to
the head of the chain.</p><h2 id=heres-the-solution-after-a-certain-amount-of-data-has-accumulated>Here&rsquo;s the solution:** after a certain amount of data has accumulated<a href=#heres-the-solution-after-a-certain-amount-of-data-has-accumulated class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>in the index we stop adding new records and create what we call an
<strong>index chunk</strong>. We can then add that <strong>chunk</strong> to IPFS, and begin a new
chunk.</p><p>A weird way to say the same thing is to say that we are creating <em>a
time-ordered log of indexes of a time-ordered log</em>.</p><h2 id=bloom-filters>Bloom Filters<a href=#bloom-filters class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Before I move on, a quick note about Bloom filters. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>Bloom
filters</a> are an
amazing data structure that do an amazing thing. They represent, in a
very compact form, set membership in a data set such as an index.</p><p>After creating each <strong>index chunk</strong>, we also create a Bloom filter in
front of that chunk that represents the set membership. In addition to
publishing the <strong>index chunk</strong> itself to IPFS, we publish the chunk&rsquo;s
Bloom filter. The Bloom filter will be seen to be super useful in
creating the system that we want to create -- a system that allows us
to distribute the index to our end users very efficiently.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-scraper>Back to the Scraper<a href=#back-to-the-scraper class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The scraper, in addition to querying each block and extracting
appearances of addresses continually inserts them into the currently
active chunk. Each time it inserts new records, it decides if the index
has grown &ldquo;large enough&rdquo;. If the index is large enough, the scraper
creates a new chunk, creates the corresponding Bloom filter, and
publishes both of these files to IPFS, storing away the hash and then it
begins accumulating the next chunk.</p><p>I won't go into a very interesting discussion of how we decide 'when a
chunk is full enough', but let me hint that the decision is easy to do
but hard to explain. We do not, as did in the original versions, break
the chunks every <em><strong>N</strong></em> blocks. It turns out that is a bad design
choice because different blocks contain significantly different numbers
of appearances. A much better way to decide when the chunk is full
enough is to break the chunks when it contains a particular number of
appearances (in our case 2,000,000 records). In this way, each chunk is
roughly the same size. We believe this best builds the chunks so that
any particular query for an address has a roughly an equal chance of
appearing in any given chunk. We will write about this fascinating issue
later.</p><p>Given a series of chunked indexes, each chunk of which has an associated
Bloom filter, we are now ready to get what we want--a list of every
appearance for an address.</p><h2 id=querying-the-index>Querying the Index<a href=#querying-the-index class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Given any address, our applications query the index chunks by scanning
through the Bloom filters looking for hits. A Bloom filter is a small
and super fast method of determining set membership. If, upon query, the
Bloom filter returns &lsquo;yes&rsquo; (it actually returns &lsquo;maybe&rsquo;), then, and only
then, do we search the much larger chunk.</p><p>If the Bloom filter <em>hits</em> (that is, it indicates that the address may
be present in the chunk), we need to open and search the associated
chunk.</p><p>If the Bloom filter <em>misses</em>, we may skip the index chunk. (A Bloom
filter is never wrong when it says a data item does not belong to the
set.) We estimate, for any given address for a &rsquo;typical&rsquo; user, nearly
90% of the Bloom filters miss. This means that the query skips nearly
90% of the index chunks. This speeds up the search significantly.</p><p>Note that the Bloom filters are small enough, in total, to store in
memory. Additionally, because the index chunks are sorted by address,
when we are forced to query the chunk, we can complete a very fast
binary search looking for appearances.</p><p>The entire process is not as fast as a straight database query because
we have to scan the list of blooms, but remember we&rsquo;re doing this
because we want to preserve the immutability (i.e. time-ordered nature)
of the data. On a web server, this scanning would be a <em>very bad idea</em>,
but our application is not a web server. Our application is local-first
software. There is but a single user! In an environment with but a
single user, one may do things that do not work on web servers.</p><p>Ah, the beauty of local-first software.</p><h2 id=fixed-width-binary-data-is-fast>Fixed-Width Binary Data is Fast!<a href=#fixed-width-binary-data-is-fast class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>There&rsquo;s another thing that makes the index search lightning fast, That
is that we store the <strong>index chunks</strong> directly as bytes of fixed-width
records. This means we do not have to parse the data as it&rsquo;s read from
the disc. I cannot stress enough how much faster this is than parsing
the file while reading it. We don&rsquo;t serialize. We don&rsquo;t parse. The data
is read directly from disc into memory as an array of fixed-width
records. Computers are really good at this.</p><p>When we&rsquo;re forced to load a full index from disc, we simply blast the
bytes into memory. The index chunk is already sorted, so we can
immediately do a fast binary search for the address. Each record in the
array is 20 bytes wide for the address and four bytes each of the
blockNumber and transactionIndex. In C++:</p><pre><code class=language-cpp>struct CAddressRecord_base {

uint8_t bytes[20];

uint32_t offset;

uint32_t cnt;

};
</code></pre><p>A bit old-fashioned, but extremely fast and portable.</p><h2 id=using-the-index>Using the Index<a href=#using-the-index class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Once in possession of the chunked index we can finally use TrueBlocks to
do what we want to do: query for a list of every appearance of an
address anywhere on the chain.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll use the TrueBlocks public wallet in the following examples. First,
we&rsquo;ll remove the address from any caches just to make sure we&rsquo;re not?
starting from a known place:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>chifra monitors --delete 0xf503017d7baf7fbc0fff7492b751025c6a78179b
</code></pre><p>Next, we list the appearances for this address:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>chifra list 0xf503017d7baf7fbc0fff7492b751025c6a78179b
</code></pre><p>If you run this command (and your scraper is caught up to the front of
the chain), you will see that chifra scans the Bloom filters, opening
the index chunks only if the Bloom filter hits.</p><p>If the address appears in the chunk, chifra caches that appearance
(again in a fixed-width binary file). The next time we list the
transaction appearances, chifra first updates to the front of the chain
and then responds very quickly because the history has been cached.</p><p>This points to a very important aspect of TrueBlocks.</p><p>TrueBlocks never extracts a piece of data from the chain until that data
is needed. Nor does TrueBlocks cache any data until the user instructs
us to by querying for that data.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, once the user tells us to extract a piece of data,
we cache it very aggressively. This is why TrueBlocks works on desktop
machines. We write a minimal amount of data at any given time. Unlike
regular ETL processes from Web 2.0, where all the data is fully
extracted at the beginning, then all the data is fully transformed at
the beginning, none of the data in TrueBlocks is extracted until it&rsquo;s
requested by the user.</p><p>This is very different to Web 2.0 (and every other Web 3.0 data pipeline
that we&rsquo;re familiar with). This is why TrueBlocks is alone in the
Ethereum space in being able to run on the end-user&rsquo;s local machine.</p><p>I think a very good definition of decentralization is that the system
allows individuals to access a system&rsquo;s data locally without asking a
&lsquo;service provider&rsquo; for access to that data. As long as the user has
access to a node (see TurboGeth) and the TrueBlocks&rsquo; index, that user
has access to any piece of data they want about their own (or anyone
else&rsquo;s) addresses. (As long as they have enough room on their computer&rsquo;s
hard drive -- the point being that the size of the hard drive should be
the decision of the end user, not the system designer.)</p><h2 id=what-to-do-with-a-list-of-appearances>What to do with a List of Appearances?<a href=#what-to-do-with-a-list-of-appearances class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Now that we have a list of appearances, what can we do with it?</p><p>The list of appearances is very small. It&rsquo;s stored in a small binary
file with the same name as the address. For any given address, this file
(which we call a <strong>monitor</strong>) contains an array of two integers:
blockNumber and transactionIndex.</p><p>The files are very, very small. Even the most heavily-used smart
contracts such as UniSwap, which appears multiple times in almost every
block, takes up only a few 100 MBs. The addresses of most of our
expected users will take up on 10s of kilobytes.</p><p>Note that we have not yet extracted the transactional details of the
transactions. We&rsquo;ve only extracted the locations of the transactions.
Remember, we never extract anything until we&rsquo;re told to.</p><p>In order to extract the transactional details for the address, we use
another <strong>chifra</strong> command:</p><p><code>chifra export 0xf503017d7baf7fbc0fff7492b751025c6a78179b</code></p><p>Finally, we&rsquo;re extracting transactional details from the chain (and
we&rsquo;re caching that data, as you might expect). Notice that we are not
caching entire blocks of data -- only the individual transactional
details for only the addresses we&rsquo;re interested in.</p><p>We store transactions in our cache by blockNumber and transactionIndex.
In this way, if another address happens to be involved in the same
transaction, the transaction is cached only once. We're very careful
about how much data we write to disc.</p><p>Notwithstanding our desire to store minimal data, during a transaction&rsquo;s
extraction, we also extract the transaction's receipts and all of its
logs. We find that it is almost always the case that this data is needed
to fully understand any given transaction. If we're doing accounting
(Ether or token accounting), we also extract the transaction's traces,
but only if they are needed to make the accounting reconcile.</p><p>There are a number of very useful options to the <strong>chifra export</strong>
command:</p><ol><li><p><strong>--appearances</strong> list only the appearances for the address</p><blockquote><p>(identical to the <strong>list</strong> option)</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>--accounting</strong> causes accounting statements to be exported for</p><blockquote><p>each transaction</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>--tokens</strong> extends the <strong>--accounting</strong> option to include token</p><blockquote><p>as well as ether accounting</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>--receipts</strong> exports only the transaction&rsquo;s receipt</p></li><li><p><strong>--logs</strong> exports only the transaction&rsquo;s event logs</p></li><li><p><strong>--traces</strong> exports all traces for the transactions</p></li></ol><p>And, a very important option, <strong>--articulate</strong> which reads any smart
contract&rsquo;s ABI and presents the ugly Ethereum byte data as English
language text. (This last is super helpful in aiding the understanding
of the data, but unfortunately is centralized by querying EtherScan.)</p><p>Note that all the <strong>chifra</strong> tools provide a few very helpful options
such as exporting its data as either <strong>json</strong> (the default), <code>csv</code>, or
<code>txt</code>. The flexibility of the output allows us to support many uses
such as our GitCoin data dump site
(<a href=https://tokenomics.io/gitcoin/>https://tokenomics.io/gitcoin/</a>),
or send it over an API to a front end application as we do for our
TrueBlocks Explorer application (using the <strong>chifra serve</strong> option).</p><p>This is what we mean by decentralization.</p><h2 id=upshot>Upshot<a href=#upshot class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>I respect Nick Johnson immensely, but he's incorrect. It is possible to
index the Ethereum blockchain effectively on a small machine.</p><h2 id=extending-the-ethereum-node-using-turbo-geth>Extending the Ethereum Node using Turbo Geth<a href=#extending-the-ethereum-node-using-turbo-geth class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Last summer, we spent time looking closely at the TurboGeth codebase. As
a result, we got super excited about the possibility of our work being
incorporated in the node (as an extension, not a core component). Turbo
Geth has shown that it&rsquo;s possible to lessen the size of the Ethereum
data from 7TB for OpenEthereum to only 1TB for TurboGeth. This means the
dream of running on smaller hardware remains alive. More nodes. More
locally.</p><p>TurboGeth adds something else to the equation. TurboGeth allows
individual developers or groups of developers to build their own custom
synchronization stages. Effectively, this is what the TrueBlocks
<strong>chifra scrape</strong> is. We&rsquo;ve convinced ourselves that the TrueBlocks
<strong>scraper</strong> (which is written in Go) can be implemented as a custom
TurboGeth stage and we intend to do that as soon as we have the
opportunity.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary<a href=#summary class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>We&rsquo;ve shown that:</p><ol><li><p>The Ethereum node is broken,</p></li><li><p>The thing that is broken is that the node does not have an index,</p></li><li><p>It is impossible to simultaneously build an continually-growing</p><blockquote><p>index and deliver that index over a content-addressable immutable

above discussion. They are included here as a placeholder and a promise
for future articles.</p><p><em>[TrueBlocks gets better with more users - a natural network
effect]</em></p><p>TrueBlocks is able to share the index it builds at near-zero cost, as
explained on this website:
<a href=https://unchainedindex.io>https://unchainedindex.io</a>.
Additionally, the way we store the index on IPFS means the system gets
better and cheaper as more and more users use the system. This is
opposite to the way current web economics work. Currently, with a
website, the more users the website gets, the more expenses are incurred
in order to provide the same level of service. This is because the
entire burden of running the infrastructure is on the people who run the
server. In Web 3.0 / content-addressable data environment, the more
users the system gets, the more those users themselves help build and
manage the infrastructure.</p><p>If two people download and pin the TrueBlocks Bloom filters on IPFS,
they are twice as likely to be found. This aspect of the system grows
exponentially. The more users the system acquires, the more likely each
new user is to find the data she&rsquo;s looking for (assuming all users are
pinning the data they use), and users will pin the data because they
want to have it FOR THEMSELVES.</p><p><em>[Heavy Users Carry a Heavier Burden. Light Users a Lighter One.]</em></p><p>One of the natural outcomes of the way our system works is that heavy
users--those that appear in almost every block--will naturally
download, pin, and carry a larger portion of the index. If an address is
super-active, it will be in every chunk. For most users, however, they
only interact once in a while. For example, our address only appears in
around 40 chunks. This seems naturally fair to us. Small users carry a
small burden. Larger users carry a larger burden.</p><p><em>[Tiny Footprint]</em></p><p>The footprint of the initial installation of the TrueBlocks system is
small. Only the Bloom filters need to be installed at first. As the user
scans the Bloom filters looking for address appearances, interesting
chunks need to be downloaded from IPFS. Once downloaded, the chunk can
then be searched and pinned on IPFS if the address is found thereby
making that chunk more likely to be found in the future by other users.
Furthermore, the end user will have the file locally, making it
significantly faster.</p><p><em>[Users Store More than Just Their Own Data]</em></p><p>Another aspect of the system is that each user stores a little bit more
data than he/she needs for his/her direct needs. Some systems that we
know of store each transaction or each block separately on IPFS. We
don&rsquo;t think this works. One does not get the benefit of one person
storing another person&rsquo;s data. We purposefully require users to store a
tiny bit more data than they actually need. In this way redundancy is
increased and the whole system improves as each new user joins the
system.</p><p><em>[TrueBlocks Data is Provably True]</em></p><p>In addition to all of the above, the TrueBlocks data is also provably
true. We prove our data by inserting into the data itself the git commit
hash of the software instructions (i.e. the code) that builds the index
chunks and Bloom filters. This hash is inserted into the manifest file
that we use to report the location of the data to our software.</p><p>The manifest is updated during the creation of each chunk by storing the
IPFS hashes of the chunk and the associated Bloom filter, adding the
IPFS hash of the file format for both the chunk and the Bloom filter and
the above mentioned git commit hash into the manifest. Each manifest
includes a hash to the previous manifest, so the user may walk his/her
way backwards through the data. We then store the manifest on IPFS as
well. Finally, we publish the IPFS hash of the manifest to an Ethereum
smart contract. See the above mentioned UnchainedIndex website for more
information.</p><p>In this way, our end-user applications always know where to go on IPFS
to get the Bloom filters. The app simply queries the Unchained Index
smart contract to find the latest hash of the manifest. Upshot - zero
cost to publish the data. Everyone has access to the data at all times
if they have access to the Ethereum chain.</p><p class=edit-page><a href=https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docs/blob/master/content/blog/2021/045-long-winded-explanation.md><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-edit-2"><path d="M17 3a2.828 2.828.0 114 4L7.5 20.5 2 22l1.5-5.5L17 3z"/></svg>Edit this page on GitHub</a></p><div class="docs-navigation d-flex justify-content-between"><a href=/blog/showing-erc-20-transfers/><div class="card my-1"><div class="card-body py-2">&larr; Showing ERC-20 Transfers</div></div></a><a class=ms-auto href=/blog/dynamic-traversers-for-trueblocks/><div class="card my-1"><div class="card-body py-2">Dynamic Traversers for TrueBlocks &rarr;</div></div></a></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 order-last order-lg-first"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-8 order-first order-lg-last text-lg-end"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-docs>Improve docs</a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=/privacy-policy/>Privacy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><script src=/js/highlight.min.39c8701213290bff3f62f8bd4a85d5a89866c0e28d00395817ab598ba2b45df2cb63eb9afb36d0b00e8f6665d8baf67a2feb26a04839b46dfb9b18ed5bcebd44.js integrity="sha512-OchwEhMpC/8/Yvi9SoXVqJhmwOKNADlYF6tZi6K0XfLLY+ua+zbQsA6PZmXYuvZ6L+smoEg5tG37mxjtW869RA==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script>
